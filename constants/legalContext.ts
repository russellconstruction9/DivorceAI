- Indiana Parenting Time Guidelines: These are based on the premise that it is usually in a child's best interest to have frequent, meaningful, and continuing contact with each parent.
  - § I(C)(3) Communication: Parents should not use the child as a messenger and should communicate respectfully. Scheduled parenting time should not be used to discuss conflicts.
  - § II(D) Transportation: Details responsibilities for transporting the child for parenting time, often involving meeting halfway or one parent handling all transportation.
  - § III(F) Relocation: A parent intending to move must file a notice of intent to relocate with the court.

- Indiana Code 31-17-2 (Custody): The court determines custody in accordance with the best interests of the child. Factors include the child's age, the parents' wishes, the child's adjustment to home/school, and the mental and physical health of all individuals involved.

- Indiana Trial Rule 60(B): Allows a party to seek relief from a court order or judgment for reasons such as mistake, fraud, or newly discovered evidence.

- Key Case Law Concepts:
  - Stonger v. Sorrell: Often cited in relocation cases, emphasizing the "best interests of the child" standard when a parent wishes to move a significant distance.
  - Glover v. Torrence: Pertains to custody modification, requiring a showing of a substantial and continuing change of circumstances.

Strategic Expansion of Legal Context for Indiana Family Law AI
This expert report details the necessary statutory, regulatory, and common-law additions required to elevate the legal assistant AI's context file from a foundational set of custody principles to an expert-level resource covering the full spectrum of Indiana family law, specifically dissolution requirements, mandatory financial obligations, property distribution, and critical procedural enforcement safeguards.

The existing context file is insufficient as it omits mandatory financial guidelines (child support, property division) and crucial procedural safeguards (emergency orders, contempt proceedings). The expansion focuses on high-impact statutes and rules, ensuring the AI can accurately identify legal relevance, jurisdictional compliance, and procedural irregularities within narrative incident reports.

I. Foundational Requirements for Dissolution and Legal Status
Before addressing the complex issues of children and finance, the AI must be equipped to analyze whether a marital dissolution or a paternity establishment proceeding meets the initial jurisdictional and temporal requirements under Indiana Code.

A. Statutory Basis of Dissolution of Marriage (IC 31-15-2)
The legal foundation for ending a marriage in Indiana is strictly governed by statutory prerequisites.

1. The "No-Fault" Principle and Irretrievable Breakdown
Indiana operates as a "no-fault" jurisdiction for dissolution of marriage. A divorce is granted based solely on a finding of the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. This principle means that the dissolution itself is not contingent upon the wrongdoing or marital misconduct of either party, though marital conduct remains a relevant factor when considering property division later in the process.   

2. Jurisdictional Requirements and Procedural Timing
For a petition for dissolution of marriage to be validly filed, one party must meet strict residency requirements: residence (or stationing) in Indiana for six months, followed by residence (or stationing) in a specific county for three months immediately preceding the filing. Furthermore, the court is prohibited from hearing the petition until a mandatory cooling-off period has passed, requiring a minimum of sixty days after the petition is filed.   

This combination of residency rules and the minimum 60-day rule establishes a strict procedural timeline. If an incident report suggests that a final dissolution decree was entered in less than sixty days following the initial filing, the decree is procedurally vulnerable due to non-compliance with IC 31-15-2. The AI must flag any temporal references that violate this mandatory waiting period.

B. Establishment of Paternity (IC 31-14)
Paternity establishment is a prerequisite for assigning legal rights, duties, and financial obligations when parents are not married.

1. Methods of Establishment and Legal Effect
Paternity can be established either by a formal order of the Court or through the proper execution of a Paternity Affidavit. Under IC 31-14-7-3, a man who has properly executed a Paternity Affidavit that has not been rescinded or set aside is legally considered the child's father.   

2. Default Custody and Legal Authority
Upon the execution of a paternity affidavit, a clear legal presumption regarding custody immediately applies: the mother automatically holds primary physical custody of the child unless and until a court intervenes and issues an order making another determination under IC 31-14.   

This default legal status presents a significant structural difference from dissolution cases. In divorce proceedings, custody begins on a neutral footing, with no presumption favoring either parent, as dictated by IC 31-17-2-8 (referenced in the original context file). However, in a paternity action relying on an affidavit, the law mandates a starting presumption that the mother holds physical custody. Therefore, the AI must differentiate its interpretation of initial custody issues based on whether the underlying action is a dissolution (neutral starting point) or a paternity proceeding (default physical custody to the mother). This distinction is vital for assessing subsequent claims for custody modification.   

3. Genetic Testing and Misrepresentation
If the mother and the affiant father wish to agree to share joint legal custody via the Paternity Affidavit, that agreement is conditioned upon the submission of genetic test results confirming the man is the biological father to a local health officer within sixty days of the child’s birth. Furthermore, Indiana law treats the knowing or intentional false naming of a man as the biological father in the affidavit as a Class A misdemeanor.   

II. Marital Estate and Equitable Distribution Principles
A significant deficiency in the initial context file is the omission of principles governing marital finances. The AI must understand Indiana's "one-pot" theory of property and the factors used to challenge the standard equal division.

A. Defining the Marital Pot (IC 31-15-7-4)
Indiana employs the "one-pot" theory, which mandates an all-inclusive approach to marital property division.

1. Inclusion of All Property Regardless of Source or Timing
Under IC 31-15-7-4, the court is required to divide the property of the parties regardless of how or when it was acquired. This division includes property that was:   

Owned by either spouse before the marriage;

Acquired by either spouse in their own right after the marriage but before the final separation; or

Acquired through their joint efforts.   

This standard dictates that any asset held by either spouse, regardless of the source or the time of acquisition, is subject to the court's jurisdiction for division.

2. Methods of Division
The court is authorized to divide the property in a just and reasonable manner through several methods, including division in kind, setting the property over to one spouse (often requiring installment payments to the other), ordering the sale of the property, or distributing future benefits such as retirement payments.   

B. The Presumption of Equal Division (IC 31-15-7-5)
While all assets are included in the marital pot, the manner of division starts with a statutory presumption in favor of equality.

1. Standard of Just and Reasonable Division
IC 31-15-7-5 establishes a strong, yet rebuttable presumption, that an equal division (50/50) of the marital property between the parties is considered just and reasonable.   

2. Rebuttal Factors Justifying Unequal Distribution
The presumption of equal division may be overcome if a party presents relevant evidence showing that an equal division would not be just and reasonable. This evidence includes factors such as:

The extent of each spouse's contribution to the acquisition of the property, irrespective of whether the contribution was income-producing (e.g., homemaker contributions).   

The extent to which the property was acquired by each spouse before the marriage, or through inheritance or gift.   

Each spouse's future income earning capacity.   

The economic circumstances of each spouse at the time of the distribution.   

The conduct of each spouse during the marriage as it relates to the dissipation or disposition of the property.   

The broad inclusion rule (the 'one-pot' theory) is functionally balanced by these rebuttal factors, particularly the factor focusing on property acquired before the marriage or by inheritance/gift. Although all assets are included, courts frequently rely on these rebuttal factors to trace and protect pre-marital or inherited wealth, allowing a party to secure a greater percentage of the assets they contributed.

3. Analysis of Financial Misconduct and Waste
Misconduct related to financial management can serve as a powerful basis for deviation from the 50/50 standard. Indiana case law clarifies that a showing of explicit waste or misuse of marital funds is not strictly required to support a deviation based on a spouse’s conduct. The relevant statute lists "disposition" and "dissipation" in the disjunctive. Therefore, documentation of excessive spending, gambling, or misuse of funds—even if not rising to the level of outright criminal waste—is a valid factor for arguing for unequal division based on financial misconduct.   

Table Title: IC 31-15-7 Statutory Principles of Marital Property

Statute	Principle	Impact for Division	Rebuttal Factors (IC 31-15-7-5)
IC 31-15-7-4	Defining the Marital Pot (Inclusion)	Includes all property owned before, during, or by joint effort, regardless of title.	(1) Contribution to acquisition
IC 31-15-7-5	Presumption of Division	Equal (50/50) division is presumed just and reasonable.	
(2) Pre-marital acquisition/inheritance 

Case Law (Dissipation)	Misconduct Standard	
Misconduct related to property disposition justifies deviation, even without explicit proof of "waste".

(3) Earning capacity/economic circumstances 

(4) Dissipation/Conduct relating to disposition 

  
III. Financial Support Obligations and Guidelines
The calculation and limitation of child support and spousal maintenance are subject to strict mandatory guidelines that must be integrated into the AI’s context for proper financial evaluation.

A. Mandatory Application of Indiana Child Support Guidelines
The Indiana Child Support Guidelines are not merely advisory recommendations; they are mandated by federal law to be applied in every instance in which child support is established. This encompasses dissolutions of marriage, legal separations, paternity actions, juvenile proceedings, and Title IV D proceedings. To comply with this mandate, Indiana requires the completion of a Child Support Obligation Worksheet to calculate the presumptive amount of support.   

B. Principles of Low-Income Cases and Deviations
The guidelines include specific provisions for low-income obligors to prevent orders that are impossible to meet. In cases of extremely low income, the court must meticulously review the calculated amount to ensure the obligor is not denied the means for self-support at a minimum subsistence level.   

This means the court must exercise caution and should not automatically attribute income at the minimum wage level to parents who are genuinely incapable of earning it, such as those with debilitating physical or mental health issues. The analysis of financial documents in incident reports must therefore consider the reason for low income, connecting the financial guidelines back to the mental and physical health factors reviewed in custody determinations.   

A separate, specific deviation exists for co-habitating parents: if parents live together with the child and share expenses, a Child Support Worksheet must still be completed, but a $0.00 order may be entered as a deviation from the calculated amount. This emphasizes that the procedural formality of calculating the presumptive amount remains mandatory, even if the resulting order is zero due to shared expenses.   

C. Statutory Framework for Spousal Maintenance
Indiana statutes draw a sharp distinction between temporary maintenance, which is subject to strict caps, and permanent maintenance awarded in the final decree.

1. Limitations on Temporary Maintenance
Temporary maintenance ordered by the court during the pendency of a case is highly regulated. It is recommended that temporary maintenance not exceed thirty-five percent (35%) of the obligor's weekly adjusted income. More critically, the total of child support and temporary maintenance combined shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the obligor's weekly adjusted income.   

This 50% combined cap represents a hard financial constraint, designed to protect the obligor's ability to support themselves. Temporary awards can be ordered as dollar payments or as "in kind" payments, such as covering utilities or mortgage payments. If an incident report details a temporary order in which the combination of child support and temporary maintenance exceeds half of the reported income of the obligor, the AI should immediately flag this as a potential violation of the Guidelines, regardless of the needs of the recipient spouse.   

2. Distinction from Property Settlements
It is important to recognize that these maintenance recommendations apply only to temporary maintenance, not to maintenance awarded in the Final Decree, which is governed by separate statutory criteria. Furthermore, care must be taken when analyzing financial documents to ensure that any deduction taken for "maintenance paid" is genuinely for maintenance and not for periodic payments stemming from the division of marital property.   

Table Title: Indiana Child Support and Temporary Maintenance Guidelines

Legal Concept	Mandatory Requirement	Limitation/Exception	Citation
Child Support Application	Required in every support proceeding (dissolution, paternity, IV-D)	Must use Child Support Obligation Worksheet	
Low Income Obligors	Must consider obligor's minimum subsistence level	Cannot automatically attribute minimum wage if parent is incapable	
Temporary Maintenance	Max 35% of weekly adjusted income (obligor)	Total Child Support + Temp Maintenance cannot exceed 50% of weekly adjusted income	
Cohabitation Deviation	Worksheet must be completed	$0.00 order may be entered as a formal deviation	
  
IV. Advanced Custody Mechanics and Parental Authority
To properly triage incident reports regarding child issues, the AI must understand the nuanced legal distinction between types of custody, the mandated information sharing rules, and the limits on judicial authority during modification proceedings.

A. Defining Physical vs. Legal Custody
The existing context file refers generally to custody (IC 31-17-2); however, incident reports often hinge on the difference between the two primary custody types.   

1. Physical Custody and Legal Custody
Physical Custody: Refers to the determination of where the child lives most of the time.   

Legal Custody: Refers to the right of parents to make important decisions concerning the child, specifically relating to education and medical care. Parents awarded joint legal custody are required to work together to make these major decisions jointly. The AI must be trained to identify decision-making conflicts (e.g., disagreement over elective surgery or school enrollment) and reference the legal custody status to determine which parent, or if both, held the requisite authority.   

B. Parental Rights to Information and Access (IPTG)
The Indiana Parenting Time Guidelines (IPTG) mandate specific duties regarding information exchange, ensuring that both parents remain fully informed.

1. Equal Rights to Records and Information Sharing
Both parents have an equal legal right to access the child's school records, medical records, and mental health records. While each parent is responsible for proactively obtaining this information on their own, the custodial parent must still actively inform the noncustodial parent of any critical medical treatments, emergencies, or ongoing health issues.   

The Guidelines make it clear that parents must actively obtain and share school, medical, and activity-related information. Because Indiana law grants an equal right to records and mandates proactive sharing, the act of passive non-disclosure (such as intentionally failing to forward a school notice or medical update) constitutes a violation of the cooperation standard required by the IPTG. If an incident report demonstrates a consistent pattern of one parent obstructing access or withholding information, the AI should flag this behavior as evidence that undermines the feasibility of Joint Legal Custody, as it indicates an inability to cooperatively manage the child’s well-being.   

2. Detailed Scheduling and Holiday Rules
The IPTG provides a standard schedule for resolving annual conflicts. Holidays are typically exercised by the noncustodial parent in even-numbered years and the custodial parent in odd-numbered years, including holidays like Martin Luther King Day. Special days, such as Mother's Day, are consistently allocated to the mother (e.g., from Friday evening to Sunday evening) regardless of the standard holiday rotation.   

C. Modification and Notice Considerations
While the user’s initial context mentions Glover v. Torrence (requiring a substantial and continuing change of circumstances for modification), the procedural nuance of relocation modification is also vital. A parent intending to relocate must file a notice of intent with the court, prompting a hearing to review and potentially modify existing orders.   

However, the initiation of a relocation hearing does not automatically place legal custody at issue. Case law based on IC 31-17-2.2-1 dictates that the trial court is prohibited from making a sua sponte (on its own motion) change to legal custody without proper notice to the parties, as the requests of the parties themselves frame the issues considered at the hearing.   

The AI must recognize that relocation primarily affects physical custody logistics and transportation arrangements, but not necessarily the legal authority structure. If an incident report discusses a modification of legal custody following only a relocation notice, the AI must flag a potential procedural error related to insufficient notice or pleading, as the trial court's scope is strictly limited by the proper initiation of a modification request.

V. Procedural Rules and Enforcement Mechanisms
The AI context must be expanded to include critical due process protections surrounding emergency temporary orders and enforcement proceedings, which often involve high conflict narratives.

A. Indiana Trial Rule 65(B): Emergency and Temporary Orders
The mechanism for obtaining temporary orders without notice (ex parte orders) is strictly constrained by Indiana Trial Rule 65(B). These temporary orders can only be granted if there is evidence presented of immediate and irreparable harm.   

A critical procedural safeguard is the mandate that the attorney requesting the order must certify in writing what notice was attempted or why notice should not be required. Failure to comply with the notice requirement and provide this written certification can lead to disciplinary action against the attorney, underscoring the necessity of these steps.   

The AI should use Trial Rule 65(B) as a two-factor authentication check for emergency custody actions. If an incident report describes a temporary custody change obtained without the other parent being heard, the AI must confirm if the narrative explicitly references "immediate harm" and if the corresponding court record would contain a "written certification." If these critical elements are absent, the resulting order is likely procedurally invalid, requiring immediate legal review.

B. Contempt of Court (IC 34-47-3)
Enforcement of existing court orders, such as for unpaid support or denied parenting time, is often pursued through contempt proceedings, which carry specific due process requirements. Because the alleged violation usually occurs outside the court's presence (e.g., non-payment, non-compliance), it is categorized as indirect contempt.

The person charged with indirect contempt is entitled to be served with a formal rule of the court before they are required to answer the charge or are punished for the contempt. This ensures the due process rights of the non-compliant party are protected. A court cannot simply punish a parent for non-compliance without issuing and properly serving this formal rule to show cause.   

C. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR Rule 2.7)
Mediation is a common requirement in Indiana family law, and the AI must understand the ethical boundaries placed upon the mediator.

Under Indiana Rules for Alternative Dispute Resolution Rule 2.7, the mediator’s role is strictly defined as neutral. The mediator must inform all parties that they are not providing legal advice, do not represent either party, and cannot determine how the court would apply the law or what the final outcome of the case would be. The mediator is explicitly prohibited from advising a party on what they should do or whether they should accept an offer. Incident reports alleging that a mediator provided legal opinions or pressured a party to settle should be flagged as potential procedural or ethical violations under ADR Rule 2.7.   

Additionally, in child-related matters, the mediator holds an affirmative duty to ensure that the parties fully consider the best interests of the children and understand the long-term consequences of the decisions they reach concerning the children.   

Table Title: Critical Indiana Procedural Safeguards in Family Law

Rule/Statute	Procedural Requirement	Consequence of Non-Compliance	Citation
Trial Rule 65(B)	Ex Parte Order Requires immediate and irreparable harm and written certification of notice attempt	Order is procedurally flawed; potential attorney reprimand	
IC 34-47-3	Indirect Contempt Requires service of a formal Rule of the Court	Punishment for contempt violates due process rights	
ADR Rule 2.7(A)	Mediator Disclosure Must advise parties mediator is not providing legal advice	Mediator conduct review/ethical violation	
IC 31-15-2-2	Dissolution Timing 60-day minimum period between filing and hearing	Final decree is procedurally vulnerable	
  
VI. Strategic Integration of Expanded Context
The assimilation of these statutes, rules, and case law principles into the AI’s data model requires structuring the information according to the legal weight and impact of the concept.

A. Recommended Data Structure for Legal Concepts
For effective triage of incident reports, the AI should classify these rules into three primary tiers:

1. Mandatory Procedural Constraints
These are rules that represent hard boundaries that, if violated, render a court action vulnerable or void. This category must include the 60-day dissolution waiting period , the strict requirements of Trial Rule 65(B) for emergency orders , the necessity of serving a Rule of the Court for indirect contempt , and the mandatory application of the Child Support Guidelines, specifically the 50% combined cap on temporary maintenance and support. Incident reports suggesting violations of these constraints should trigger the highest alert priority.   

2. Rebuttable Presumptions
These concepts establish a starting point that must be confirmed or challenged by evidence. This includes the presumption of a 50/50 division of marital property  and the default physical custody of the mother upon proper execution of a Paternity Affidavit. The AI should categorize evidence within incident reports that attempts to rebut these standards, such as claims of dissipation of assets  or documentation of pre-marital acquisition.   

3. Cooperation Standards
These rules govern the conduct expected of co-parents, primarily found within the Indiana Parenting Time Guidelines (IPTG). They include rules regarding communication and the equal right and duty to access and share school and medical records. Evidence of violation of these standards suggests an inability of the parents to cooperate, which directly impacts the feasibility and appropriateness of joint legal custody.   

B. Prioritization for AI Incident Report Triage
Integrating these expanded legal concepts allows the AI to perform rapid, high-impact legal triage on submitted reports:

Financial Triage via the 50% Rule: The constraint limiting combined temporary maintenance and child support to 50% of the obligor’s weekly adjusted income  is a non-negotiable financial limit. Any reported temporary order that appears to exceed this threshold must be flagged instantly as potentially overreaching judicial discretion.   

Emergency Triage via TR 65(B) Certification: When reviewing narratives describing emergency actions, the AI must actively search for language related to ex parte orders and evaluate if the accompanying narrative contains the required criteria of "immediate and irreparable harm" and whether the filing was accompanied by the required "written certification" detailing notice attempts.   

Custody Triage via Legal vs. Physical Authority: The AI data model must be structured to explicitly distinguish between the legal authority (major decision-making on education/medical issues) and physical custody (residence). This prevents the conflation of scheduling conflicts with violations of legal decision-making rights.

Indiana Family Law Principles

Parenting Time Guidelines: Indiana’s parenting time rules presume it is in a child’s best interest to have frequent, meaningful, continuing contact with both parents. The Guidelines cover communication, exchanges, transportation, make-up time, holidays, and relocation. For example, parents are instructed not to use the child as a go-between (children should not ferry messages) and should communicate respectfully (no arguing about conflicts during visits)
einhornlawyers.com
indyjustice.com
. Make‑up visitation is generally allowed for time missed due to factors beyond a parent’s control (illness, work, military duty), but it must be scheduled promptly and cannot be used to deny the other parent holidays or special days
indyjustice.com
. The 2022 updates add guidance for public health emergencies (affirming that existing orders remain enforceable but allowing joint written modifications approved by the court when emergencies interfere with compliance)
indyjustice.com
indyjustice.com
.

§ I(C)(3) Communication: Parents must promptly pass on all messages from the other parent to the child (including voicemails, texts, emails) and must not record or interfere with the child’s communications
indyjustice.com
. Parents are also warned not to argue or discuss adult issues in the child’s presence.

§ II(D) Transportation: The Guidelines usually call for parents to share transportation responsibilities (often meeting halfway), although specifics can vary by case. New commentary advises parents to avoid bringing new third parties to exchanges and discourages using police stations for drop-offs unless there is a history of violence or a protective order
indyjustice.com
.

§ III(F) Relocation: If a parent plans to move the child a significant distance, they must file a Notice of Intent to Relocate with the court. Under Indiana Code §31-17-2.2-1, the moving parent must notify the court and the other parent (even the noncustodial parent) at least 30 days before the move (formerly 90 days)
indyjustice.com
. Notice isn’t required if the move keeps the child in the same school and brings the households closer or changes distance by less than 20 miles. If the other parent objects, the court holds a hearing to decide whether relocation (and any custody/parenting-time changes) serve the child’s best interest.

Child Custody (IC 31-17-2): Indiana courts award custody based on the child’s best interests, with no legal presumption favoring the mother or father
womenslaw.org
. Code §31-17-2-8 lists factors the court must consider in determining best interests: the child’s age and sex; the wishes of the parents; the child’s own wishes (given more weight if age 14 or older)
womenslaw.org
; the child’s relationship with each parent, with siblings, and with any others significantly involved in the child’s life
womenslaw.org
; and the child’s adjustment to home, school, and community
womenslaw.org
. Critically, the court must consider the mental and physical health of everyone involved
womenslaw.org
 and any history or pattern of domestic/family violence by either parent
womenslaw.org
. The court also notes if a nonparent (a de facto custodian) has cared for the child, in which case it may consider additional factors (per IC 31-17-2-8.5). Custody can be legal (decision-making authority) and/or physical (with whom the child lives). Joint legal custody may be awarded only if the court finds it serves the child’s welfare
law.onecle.com
; joint physical custody (equal or divided time) is allowed but not required to be equal
law.onecle.com
.

Custody Modification (IC 31-17-2-21): Once custody is ordered, it remains in place unless circumstances change significantly. By statute, a court may not modify a custody order unless (1) the change is in the child’s best interests and (2) there is a substantial change in one or more factors considered at the original hearing
law.onecle.com
. In practice, this means a parent seeking to change custody must show that conditions have materially and persistently changed since the last order (for example, a parent’s remarriage, relocation, or a change in either parent’s health or criminal circumstances), and that the change affects the child’s well-being. Many cases (e.g. Glover v. Torrence) reaffirm that both elements (best interests plus substantial change) are required. This statutory framework makes custody modification difficult without clear new evidence of a changed situation
law.onecle.com
.

Child Support (IC 31-16-6): Indiana law allows the court to order either or both parents to pay child support as needed. Factors for setting support include each parent’s income/resources and the child’s needs. Indiana Code §31-16-6-1 directs courts to consider, for example, the financial resources of each parent and the standard of living the child would have had if the marriage were intact
law.justia.com
. The court also considers the child’s physical and educational needs
law.justia.com
. By policy, payments are typically set by the statewide Child Support Guidelines (based on income and parenting time), and then income withholding is ordered for collection. Child support obligations generally terminate when the child turns 19 (or graduates high school, whichever is later), unless the child is still in school or incapacitated
law.justia.com
.

Relocation Notice (IC 31-17-2.2): Separate from the Parenting Time Guidelines, Indiana Code §31-17-2.2-1 requires a parent with custody or parenting-time rights to file a Notice of Intent to Relocate if they plan to move the child more than 20 miles or to a different school district. The notice must be filed with the court and served on the other parent. The recent changes mentioned above shorten the notice period to 30 days. Failure to comply can lead the court to block the move or modify custody/visitation. This statute ensures the non-moving parent and the court can challenge or approve significant moves.

Modification of Parenting Time: Unlike custody, parenting-time schedules (visitation) can generally be modified more readily if the change serves the child’s best interests. Indiana courts encourage flexibility (e.g. make-up time for missed visits, trading weekends, etc.) as long as the overall contact remains frequent and meaningful. However, the court still examines the child’s needs and parents’ circumstances for any major changes. Special provisions apply for holiday schedules (the Guidelines set default holiday splits and now tie holiday parenting time to school calendars)
indyjustice.com
.

Indiana Trial Rule 60(B): In family cases, either party may seek relief from a final judgment or order (including custody/support orders) under Indiana Trial Rule 60(B). The rule allows reopening an order for reasons like mistake, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, or fraud
in.gov
. However, the motion must be made within a reasonable time – generally not more than one year after entry when based on mistake, newly discovered evidence, or fraud
in.gov
. Relief under Rule 60(B) does not affect the judgment’s finality unless granted, and it does not extend the time for appeal. Rule 60(B) is often used if a party learns after the fact that the court was misled or overlooked material facts, but courts interpret it narrowly to avoid disturbing final orders except for compelling reasons.

Key Case Law: Several Indiana cases illustrate these principles. Stonger v. Sorrell (750 N.E.2d 391 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001), aff’d on reh’g, 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ind. 2002)) is a leading relocation case emphasizing that any move must be judged by the child’s best interests, with no presumption the child should stay in the original school or home district. In Glover v. Torrence (Ind. Ct. App. 1998), the court underscored that to modify custody, the petitioner must demonstrate a substantial, continuing change in circumstances affecting the child – simply showing a child’s preference or minor changes is insufficient. (These cases align with the statutory standards above.)

Other Relevant Laws: Indiana’s family law context also includes paternity, child welfare, and inter-state support provisions. For example, IC 31-14 governs establishment of paternity and attendant support/custody issues when a child is born out of wedlock. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (IC 31-17-3) sets rules for interstate custody cases. Domestic violence statutes (e.g. IC 31-9) provide for protective orders, which may affect custody and visitation. Adoption (IC 31-19) and guardianship laws apply when parental rights are terminated or transferred. While not the focus of everyday custody disputes, these laws can become important in family cases involving child safety or interstate issues.
